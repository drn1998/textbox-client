# textbox-client
The textbox is supposed to be the 21th century evolution of the payphone: Provide basic communication (e-mail, text messaging, fixed-line calls, SOS) even when you lost your mobile device.

Client: Software running on the esp32 inside the telebox. Server will be a setup with PHP scripts and an Asterisk configuration to provide HTTP-assisted E-Mail and text messaging as well as basic telephony. Please notice that this is a very new project; design sketches etc. are by no means done and there is currently no outdoor-proof hardware implementation.
